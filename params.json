{"name":"TDBadgedCell","body":"### Meet TDBadgedCell version 2\r\nTDBadgedCell grew out of the need for TableViewCell badges and the lack of them in iOS (see the [article explaining this on TUAW](http://www.tuaw.com/2010/01/07/iphone-devsugar-simple-table-badges/). TDBadgedCell was written originally using CGPaths but as more people began to use TDBadgeCell the more customisation people wanted.\r\n\r\nTo set the content of your badge (NSString) simply do:\r\n\r\n```Objective-C\r\ncell.badgeString = @\"130990\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can set _badgeColor_ and _badgeColorHighlighted_ to modify the colour of the badges:\r\n\r\n```Objective-C\r\ncell.badgeColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.792 green:0.197 blue:0.219 alpha:1.000];\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also specify a border radius for your badges:\r\n\r\n```Objective-C\r\ncell.badge.radius = 9;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand you can also turn on shadows for the cells selected state:\r\n\r\n```Objective-C\r\ncell.showShadow = YES;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of those different options enabled in the demo app.\r\n\r\n![Example Image](http://f.cl.ly/items/1e1n133e180c2L292s47/Untitled.png)\r\n\r\n### Licence and that stuff\r\nTDBadgedCell is a free to use class for everyone. I wrote it so people could have the badges Apple never provided us with. If you modify the source please share alike and if you think you've improved upon what I have written I recomend sending me a pull request.\r\n\r\n**Please note:** If you are using TDBadgedCell in your project please make sure you leave credit where credit is due. Chances are I won't notice if you haven't left credit but karma willâ€¦","tagline":"Add badges to your table cells","google":"UA-30626340-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
